A modern web-based version of the classic game **Minesweeper**, built with React. This project serves as a solid portfolio piece, demonstrating core front-end development skills in state management, event handling, and dynamic UI rendering.

### **🎮 Features**

- **Dynamic Board Generation**: The game board, including mine placement and number calculations, is generated on the fly.
- **Recursive Logic**: Empty squares automatically clear adjacent empty cells, just like in the original game.
- **Flagging System**: Mark potential mine locations with a right-click.
- **Timer & Game State**: A simple timer and clear game-over/win states.

---

### **🛠️ Tech Stack**

- ⚛️ **React**: The primary library for building the user interface.
- 🎨 **Styled-components**: Used for styling components with a modern CSS-in-JS approach.
- 📦 **JavaScript**: Powers the core game logic.
